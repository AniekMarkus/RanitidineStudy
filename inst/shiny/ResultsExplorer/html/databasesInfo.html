<p>Find below general information about the included databases in this study.</p>

<h3>Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI), Netherlands, Erasmus University</h3>

<p>
IPCI is collected from EHR records of patients registered with their GPs throughout the Netherlands. The selection of 391 GPs is representative of the entire country. The database contains records from 1.4 million patients out of a Dutch population of 17M (8.2%) starting in 1996. The median follow-up is 2.2 years. The observation period for a patient is determined by the date of registration at the GP and the date of leave/death. The observation period start date is refined by many quality indicators, e.g. exclusion of peaks of conditions when registering at the GP. All data before the observation period is kept as history data. Drugs are captured as prescription records with product, quantity, dosing directions, strength and indication. The duration of the drug exposure is determined for all drugs in the database by: 1. The amount and dose extracted from the sig or if instruction is “see product instructions” we use the DDD and quantity; 2. Duration available in the record; 3. If option 1 and 2 is not possible we use the DDD derived duration, use the modal duration or default to 30 days dependent on the drug of interest. Drugs not prescribed in the GP setting might be underreported. Indications are available as diagnoses by the GPs and, indirectly, from secondary care providers but the latter might not be complete. Approval needs to be obtained for each study from the Governance Board. (Vlug, van der Lei et al. 1999)")"</p>

<h3>Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP), Spain, IDIAP Jordi Gol</h3>
SIDIAP is also collected from EHR records of patients receiving primary care delivered through Primary Care Teams (PCT), consisting of GPs, nurses and non-clinical staff. The Catalan Health Institute manages 286 out of 370 such PCT with a coverage of 5.6M patients, out of 7.5M people in the Catalan population (74%). The database started to collect data in 2006. The mean follow-up is 10 years. The observation period for a patient can be the start of the database (2006), or when a person is assigned to a Catalan Health Institute primary care centre. Date of exit can be when a person is transferred-out to a primary care centre that does not pertain to the Catalan Health Institute, or date of death, or date of end of follow-up in the database. Drug information is available from prescriptions and from dispensing records in pharmacies. For the prescription records the duration is available directly from the EHR system, for dispensing the duration is inferred using the quantity, dosage, and DDD of each drug. Indication diagnoses are available from GP or hospital admission records. Drugs not prescribed in the GP setting might be underreported; and disease diagnoses made at specialist care settings are not included. Studies using SIDIAP data require previous approval by both a Scientific and an Ethics Committee. (Garcia-Gil Mdel, Hermosilla et al. 2011)

<h3>Longitudinal Patient Database (LPD) Belgium (IQVIA)</h3>
LPD Belgium is a computerised network of GPs who contribute to a centralised database of anonymised data of patients with ambulatory visits. Currently, around 300 GPs from 234 practices are contributing to the database covering 2.35M patients from a total of 11.5M Belgians (20.4%). The database covers an time period from 2010 through the present. Observation time is defined by the first and last consultation dates. Drug information is derived from GP prescriptions. 61% of the prescriptions contain information about intended duration. For the remaining records, duration can be inferred from package size and signatur information, which is available for 86% of prescriptions. 96.9% of drug exposure records specify the strength of the prescribed product, allowing to calculate daily dose information. Drugs obtained over the counter by the patient outside the prescription system are not reported. No explicit registration or approval is necessary for drug utilization studies.

<h3>Disease Analyser (DA) Germany (IQVIA).</h3>
DA Germany is collected from extracts of patient management software used by GPs and specialists practicing in ambulatory care settings. Data coverage includes more than 38.7M distinct person records out of at total population of 80M (48.4%) in the country, and collected from 2,734 providers. Patient visiting more than one provider are not cross-identified for data protection reasons and therefore recorded as separate in the system. Dates of service include from 1992 through present. Observation time is defined by the first and last consultation dates. Germany has no mandatory GP system and patient have free choice of specialist. As a result, data are collected from visits to 28.8% General, 13.4% Orthopedic Surgery, 11.8% Otolaryngology, 11.2% Dermatology, 7.7% Obstetrics/Gynecology, 6.2% various Neurology and Psychiatry 7.0% Pediatric, 4.6% Urology, 3.7% Cardiology, 3.5% Gastroenterology, 1.5% Pulmonary and 0.7% Rheumatology practices. Drugs are recorded as prescriptions of marketed products containing information about package size, of which 92.% have strength information. 24.9% also contain information about explicit duration. No registration or approval is required for drug utilization studies.

<h3>Disease Analyser (DA) France (IQVIA).</h3>
DA France consists of data collected from outpatient general practitioner practices and medical centers. Data coverage includes more than 7.1M patients in a population of 67M (10.7%), 2,337 providers practicing at 550 care sites. Patients are not linked across practices. Dates of service include from 2009 through present. Observation time is defined by the first and last consultation dates. Drug information is recorded from prescriptions, which indicate marketed products, all of which come with package size and strength information. 79.6% of the prescriptions also indicate intended days of supply, which allows the calculation of duration and daily dosage. No registration or approval is required for drug utilization studies

<h3>IMRD – UK (IQVIA)</h3>
IMRD UK is a large database of anonymised electronic medical records collected at Primary Care clinics throughout the UK. Data coverage includes 15.2M patients, 5.6M providers, 793 care sites and more than 5 billion service records, covering 22.5% of a population of 67.5M. Dates of service include from 1996 through present. Quality indicators define the start date for that patient (e.g. each patient’s observation period began at the latest of: the patient’s registration date, the acceptable mortality recording date of the practice, the Vision date). The end of the observation period is determined by the end date of registration in the database. Drug treatment is recorded as prescriptions, of which 89.3% have a known quantity. Intended duration is only provided in 2.7%, requiring duration to be inferred from the quantity and the parsing the daily signatur provided in 98.7% of the records. Drug strength is known in 69%. All protocols have to be submitted to an independent Scientific Review Committee prior to study conduct.
